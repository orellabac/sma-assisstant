# SMA Assistant

![Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orellabac/sma-assistant/main/logo.jpeg)

The [Snowpark Migration Accelerator (SMA)](https://www.snowflake.com/snowflake-professional-services/snowpark-migration-accelerator/) is designed to report "issues" to you regarding the code that it migrates.

At it's core, it is both an accelerator AND a troubleshooter.

The SMA is designed to convert what it can, but also to tell you everything that it can about what it cannot convert.

This extension tried to make it easy to link this issues with the SMA knowlegde base and whenever possible automate some quick fixes.

# Using the SMA Assistant

The first step is to first, download the [SMA](https://www.snowflake.com/snowflake-professional-services/snowpark-migration-accelerator/) and [convert some code](https://docs.snowconvert.com/sma/user-guide/conversion).

The SMA is an accelerator. That means its purpose is to make your journey to snowpark easier but there will be still some tasks to perform.

When you open your migrated code in VS Code with the SMA assistant, it will populate the problems views with identified tags inserted by SMA.

Your code is considered ready for testing when you have removed all the SMA issues.

The SMA also provides some quick fixes that can be applied to your code. And if you select the learn me option it will take to the SMA documentation which will provide some guidance on how to add the missing functionality.
