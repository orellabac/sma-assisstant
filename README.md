# SMA Assistant

The [Snowpark Migration Accelerator (SMA)](https://www.snowflake.com/snowflake-professional-services/snowpark-migration-accelerator/) is designed to report "issues" to you regarding the code that it migrates.

At it's core, it is both an accelerator AND a troubleshooter.

The SMA is designed to convert what it can, but also to tell you everything that it can about what it cannot convert.

This extension tried to make it easy to link this issues with the SMA knowlegde base and whenever possible automate some quick fixes.
